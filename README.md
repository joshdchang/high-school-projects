# Some projects I made in high school

Note: some of these are broken now
 
* [2020 Election Model](https://joshdchang.github.io/election-model) - My statistical model of the 2020 election (it was right in all but 2 states)
* [JEXOR Cipher](/jexor) - My own little encryption algorithm for plain text
* [Precipitation Model](/precip) - A model I made that predicts precip for the next hour in Irvington, NY based on radar outputs (I don't think the server for this is working anymore)
* [Sign-In UI Demo](/authtest) - A demo of a sign-in user interface I made as an experiment
* [Weather Forecast UI Demo](/weathertexts/live) - A demo of a user interface displaying a weather forecast I made to test my design skills
* [End of School Countdown (2019)](/school) - A fun little countdown I made near the end of the 2018-2019 school year
* [Ticketing System](/tickets) - The web interface for a ticketing system I made (it will only work with a link for a valid ticket)
* [COVID-19 Vaccine Appointment Finder (New York State)](/vaccine) - A Firefox Extension I made to scan for vaccine appointments in NYS in the next week and book them automatically
* [Irvington High School Art Website](https://ihsartists.net/) - I completely rebuilt the IHSartists.net website from scratch with dynamic content and mobile support, as well as an intuitive and fully featured purpose-built content management system (CMS)
* [Irvington High School Newspaper Website](https://ihspawprint.com/) - I did a redesign for the IHS Paw Print Website and created a special section for the 2020 election
